Build a simple Python-based web app that allows users to upload financial files (Excel, CSV, PDF, or Images). The app must parse the files locally using Python libraries (pandas, openpyxl, pdfplumber, pytesseract) to extract basic structured data: description, amount, date/period. Then, the extracted data must be sent to GPT-4.1 via API call to categorise each transaction into standard accounting categories (Revenue, Expenses, etc.) following New Zealand English spelling conventions.

After categorisation, the results should be displayed on the web app as a simple financial table and basic charts (e.g., bar chart for Revenue vs Expenses). Users can download a reorganised Excel file with the categorised data. Store a simple upload history locally (e.g., in a JSON or SQLite file). All code should be based on Python using Streamlit or FastAPI+HTML for the frontend. OpenAI API key must be read securely from a config file or .env file. No cloud storage or OAuth needed â€” local-only operation.
